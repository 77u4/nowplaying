##FAQ
####Why does it take so long to refresh?
It gets the new meta information (song, album, artist, cover) every 4 seconds (the background refreshes every 5 seconds) to save the lastfm API from getting overloaded. It's also more reliable when it takes longer. You can change it in `index.html` if you know, what you're doing.
####How can I change the period of the top artists statistics?
Change `$period`in `lastfm.php` to either `overall`, `7day`, `1month`, `3month`, `6month` or `12month`.
####I found a bug!
